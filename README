WeatherBaloon is a command line application. The main class is named WeatherballoonApplication. 
The program was developed by following the specs listed at https://gist.github.com/dbousamra/66cab2034e4f212553fb

The application retrieves the lookup data from application.properties.

It has 3 modes of operation:

===========================
1- Creation of smaple date
===========================
*Arguments: generate-data [--file=FILENAME] [--lines=NUMBER]
*file defaults to balloondata.txt and lines defaults to the value stored in the properties file
  
*The inclusion of invalid data can be checked in NoisyObservationsFormatter.java

================
2- Statistics
================
*Arguments: generate-stats [--file=FILENAME]
*file defaults to balloondata.txt

========================
3- Normalization of data
========================
*Arguments: normalize [--file=SOURCE_FILENAME] [--normalized=NORMALIZED_FILENAME] --temperature=[KELVIN|CELCIUS|FHARENHEIT] --distance=[KILOMETERS|METERS|MILES]
*file defaults to normalized-balloondata.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*As we have three modes of operation, when more than one mode is passed as an argument, only the smallest mode of operation will be executed. 

*Corrupted data will be discarded.

#1 THING I DID NOT FINISH: I didn't code mode #3. The way I work can still be identified. 
#1 HOW I WOULD DO IT: use the units conversors I have coded as ENUMS and write write the data to a file. 

#2 THING I DID NOT FINISH: Sort unordered data 
#1 HOW I WOULD DO IT: external merge sort
